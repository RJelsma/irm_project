## General Information
My project will be looking at the changes in frequency of a common Dutch grammatical error on Twitter overtime, to study the way meticulousness in language on social media has developed overtime. This project is part of the Introduction to Research Methods course, and as such has to be completed within a limited timespan, which limits the amount of time and effort that can be put into it.

## Background Information
To prepare for this project, I looked into similar studies. While there were no studies that highlighted errors in Dutch grammar on Twitter, there were a few that looked into the effects of social media on grammar in different demographic groups (Nabati (2018), Wong (2020)).

## Research Question
My chosen research question is “How has the frequency of the -d/-dt error in first-person singular phrases on Twitter changed overtime?". The reason I've chosen to look specifically at first-person singular phrases is because there are no exceptions to the -d/-dt rule. A verb associated with a first-person singular never ends in -dt. This makes it easier and quicker to develop a program or script that correctly processes the errors. Since time is a limited commodity in regards to this project, this specification seemed like a good way of keeping the scope of the project narrow enough to be manageable.

My hypothesis in regards to my research question is that the frequency of errors with -d/-dt verb forms on Twitter has increased, due to the increasingly casual nature of social media as a whole, which leads to people being less careful with their use of language.

## Method
To answer my research question, I will be using the in-house Twitter corpus. I will write a script or program using regular expressions that can filter incorrect uses of -d/-dt in a first-person singular context, then examine the results to find any trends or patterns. I will be using tweets from randomly selected dates as to not externally influence the results.
